![Design and Develop a Serverless Event-Driven Microservice-Based Solution (Workshop)](images/thumbnail.png)

## Short Abstract
Hands-on full-day workshop where you will design, develop, and publish a serverless event-driven microservice-based solution.

## Abstract
You have heard all the buzzwords such as microservices, event-driven architecture, serverless, etc. You probably have attended sessions that talk about these terms. But how do you put all that together?

During this full-day workshop, you will start by designing a solution using serverless and event-driven cloud services using microservice patterns. Then you will build that solution using .NET, Azure services, and other best-practice tools. Finally, you will deploy that solution to the cloud so your customers can reap the rewards of a well-architected, reliable, and scalable solution that meets their needs today and provides for growth in the future.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the different serverless, event-driven cloud services and how to put them together to build a cohesive microservice-based architecture
- Build a working serverless event-driven microservice-based solution using best practices based upon real-world experience of what has worked and what has not
- Get hands-on experience deploying the solution you have built using continuous integration/continuous development tools that make it easy to keep your solution updated with the latest changes
